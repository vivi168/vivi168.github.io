This is gonna be a pretty long so I've decided to split it into multiple posts.

I was playing Mother 2 on the Super Famicom I brought back from Japan when it
struck me: How the hell did they program those game anyway?

And here I was, looking around on the internet for answers. I managed to finish
Mother 2, and then I wanted to play Star Ocean, and I just couldn't put my mind
into it: I was constently wondering what tricks programmers used to do this and
that.

It's now been a month, and I finally managed to put together a nice working
demo [available here](https://github.com/vivi168/SNES_utils). As of now, it
shows Mario and a background.

(Yeah that's right, the title of the smc file is "RPG" üòÖ)

So, given that SNES resource is quite sparce, and sometime quite hard to
understand, I've decided to take a shot and write my own article.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Keep in mind, I'm just a beginner, and I'm sure not everything I will show
you is best practice/exactly right. I've not yet understood every concept
fully, but hopefully, you can learn something from me.

First of all, appart from the official SNES manual which I won't link here,
(GIYF), I want to cite the three most useful resources I've found:

* [https://georgjz.github.io/snesaa01/](https://georgjz.github.io/snesaa01/)
* [Super NES Features](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHQ0utQyFw5KCcj1ljIhExH_lvGwfn6GV)
(There are acually five article, just switch 1 in the link with 2,3,4 & 5)
* [https://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm](https://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm)

You should first watch the videos, then read the articles from Georgz, then
come back to the videos and finally read the problemkaputt page. All of this
while read the official manual of course, which is trully unvaluable and the
utlimate source of knowledge. But I have to admit it's sometimes a little
cryptic, and thus I had to rely on online information to understand it fully.

Enough talking, here is the summary of what we're going to see:

## Summary

* DMA
* Color palettes
* Objects (sprites)
* Backgrounds
